# Target board/hardware (BSP).
# To change the target, it is recommended to use the Library manager
# ('make library-manager' from command line), which will also update 
# Eclipse IDE launch configurations.
TARGET=KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2

# Name of toolchain to use. Options include:
#
# GCC_ARM 	-- GCC is available as part of ModusToolbox Setup program
# ARM     -- ARM Compiler (must be installed separately)
# IAR     -- IAR Compiler (must be installed separately)
# LLVM_ARM	-- LLVM Embedded Toolchain (must be installed separately)
#
# See also: CY_COMPILER_PATH below
TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM

#For IAR/ARM/LLVM_ARM; uncomment the lines below to add path to the compiler (Note: Update the path as required)
#CY_COMPILER_IAR_DIR=C:/Program Files/IAR Systems/Embedded Workbench 9.2/arm
#CY_COMPILER_ARM_DIR=C:/Program Files/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.22
#CY_COMPILER_LLVM_ARM_DIR=C:/Program Files/LLVM-ET-Arm-19.1.5-Windows-x86_64

# Default build configuration. Options include:
#
# Debug -- build with minimal optimizations, focus on debugging.
# Release -- build with full optimizations
# Custom -- build with custom configuration, set the optimization flag in CFLAGS
# 
# If CONFIG is manually edited, ensure to update or regenerate 
# launch configurations for your IDE.

#Config file for postbuild sign and merge operations.
#NOTE:Check the JSON file for the command parameters

# Building ifx-mcuboot with ARM compiler requries some
# specific symbols. However, linking when ifx-mcuboot is 
# added as a library to an existing project,
# those symbols are not required. Excluding those symbols, 
#which are not needed for this application build
